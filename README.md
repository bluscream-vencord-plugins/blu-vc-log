## Event Types

The plugin distinguishes between different types of voice events:

- **Join**: User moves from one voice channel to another (or joins from no channel)
- **Leave**: User moves from a voice channel to another (or leaves to no channel)
- **Connect**: User connects to voice for the first time (no previous channel)
- **Disconnect**: User disconnects from voice entirely (no new channel)
- **Moved**: User moves between voice channels (when not monitoring own channel)
- **Mute/Unmute**: User mutes or unmutes themselves
- **Deafen/Undeafen**: User deafens or undeafens themselves
- **Camera On/Off**: User enables or disables their camera
- **Stream Start/Stop**: User starts or stops streaming
- **Server Mute/Unmute**: User gets muted or unmuted by server/admin
- **Server Deafen/Undeafen**: User gets deafened or undeafened by server/admin

## Empty Template Behavior

If any message template is left empty, the plugin will skip processing that event type entirely. This allows you to disable specific event types by simply clearing their message templates.

## Example Custom Messages

- **Join**: `[{now}] <@{userid}> joined {newChannelName} in {guildName}`
- **Leave**: `[{now}] <@{userid}> left {oldChannelName} in {guildName}`
- **Connect**: `[{now}] <@{userid}> connected to {newChannelName} in {guildName}`
- **Disconnect**: `[{now}] <@{userid}> disconnected from {oldChannelName} in {guildName}`
- **Moved**: `[{now}] <@{userid}> moved from {oldChannelName} to {newChannelName} in {guildName}`

## Console Logging

When console logging is enabled, the plugin will:

- Log detailed information to Discord's console
- Track all voice state update events with formatted JSON data
- Show processing steps and decisions

### Using Console Logging

1. Enable "Console Logging" in the plugin settings
2. Open Discord DevTools (Ctrl+Shift+I) → Console tab
3. Perform voice channel actions (join/leave) to generate debug data
4. Check console for detailed debugging information

### Log Locations

- **Console**: Open Discord DevTools (Ctrl+Shift+I) → Console tab

Console logs include:

- Voice state update events with full data objects
- Channel and guild information
- Message formatting details
- Decision logic and filtering reasons

## How It Works

The plugin listens to Discord's `VOICE_STATE_UPDATES` flux events to detect when users join or leave voice channels. When an event is detected:

1. It determines if the event should be logged based on your settings
2. Finds the associated text channel for the voice channel
3. Formats the message using your custom templates
4. Sends the message as Clyde to the text channel

## Installation

1. Copy the `blu-vc-log` folder to your Vencord `src/userplugins` directory
2. Rebuild Vencord: `npm run build`
3. Restart Discord
4. Enable the plugin in Vencord settings
5. Configure your preferred message formats
